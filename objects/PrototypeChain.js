/*
  in console
  youssef --> the name of the object

  youssef.prototype;
  Person.prototype;

  youssef.__proto__ === Person.prototype;


  youssef also have a prototype of object prototype
  so that cuz all of the objects is already instance of
  the object-object

  youssef.hasOwnProperty('job') //true
  youssef.hasOwnProperty('lastName') //false

  because lastName is inherited from Prototype

  youssef instanceOf Person // True


   //Every thing is an object
   var x = [2,4,6]
   console.info[x];

   length property stored in array object
   and you can see the prototype of the array
   and u can use all methods //
